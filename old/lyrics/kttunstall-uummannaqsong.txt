Hold your fire 
I'm coming out and I'll tell you the truth 
I was trying to raise my roof 
Did you see it 
That I needed to prove 
That my stinger always stays 
You said she's beautiful when she plays 
Did I hit you in the proper place 

Suddenly 

[Chorus 1]
I, oh well I could live in this town 
Five cold years before I 
Yes I could live in this town 
Before I head for home 

It's my turn 
With the spotlight burning a hole 
But my bird-heart's turning cold 
As the temperature rises all around 
To the sound of a ticking bomb 
And then it’s not just showing off here 
You know there's something going on here 
Going on here 

Suddenly 

[Chorus 2]
I, oh well I could live in this town 
Five cold years before I 
Yes I could live in this town 
Five cold years 
Yes I could live in this town 
Five cold years before I 
Well I could live in this town 
Before I head for home 

And considered it odd 
That I ever stayed 

You know that feeling you get 
when you don't want to leave 

That feeling when you don’t want to leave 

[Chorus]
I, oh well I could live in this town 
Five cold years before I 
Yes I could live in this town 
Five cold years 
Yes I could live in this town 
Five cold years before I 
Well I could live in this town 
Before I head for home 

And considered it odd 
That I ever stayed
