The girl and the ghost
Sit in the corner
The girl and the ghost
Seems they have a lot to say
The girl and the ghost
Haven't seen each other in 3 years
The girl and the ghost
Feel simple seconds slipped away
Slipped away

A phenomenal that sets off the eternal trigger
That lets the light through that usually goes
Around and around and around

The girl and the ghost
Meet in the corridor
The girl and the ghost
They touch fingers and walk right through
The girl and the ghost
Feel so familiar and fearless
The girl and the ghost
Know each other like other people do whoa
Other people do
Other people do

The ghost and the girl
Commonly connected by something bigger
A phenomenal that sets off the eternal trigger
That lets the light through that usually
Ghost and the girl

A phenomenal that sets off the eternal trigger
That lets the light through that usually goes
Around and around and around

Around and around and around
